### Homework
- Continue working on your project revising it based on today. Have a draft of all the screens you&rsquo;ll present and outline of the actual presentation.
- Think about what kind of brand extensions you can create to extend your system into something else (website, animations, t shirts, physical objects). Have a draft of what this will be (this should be integrated into your presentation)
- Next week is the final work day so the more you have the more we can finetune.
