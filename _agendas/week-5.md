- Observe and document how you interact with your phone. Create an are.na channel that houses your research. Potential ideas for entries: the screen time section of your phone, making a list of things you do on your phone, taking screenshots while you&rsquo;re browsing things on your phone.
- Based on your research, develop three distinct ideas for your Screen Time project and be prepared to present them. Your presentation should either be an InVision document, google slides document or a PDF. The presentation should be thoughtfully laid out. Each direction should include: a title, a sentence or two describing the direction, a visual depiction of your screen time research, what you plan on doing with the research, visual references, and anything else you feel necessary to communicate what your plans are.
