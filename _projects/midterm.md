### Overview

Surrounded by screens, the digital revolution has transformed our day to day lives in numerous ways. Some of these changes are amazing – making work more efficient, connecting different parts of the world together, and the ability to learn from each other easily are a few of them. On the other hand, some of the changes have been corrupted by greedy corporations trying to create addictive habits and expose us to as many advertisements as possible. These changes are not unnoticed, where even phone manufacturers such as Apple are providing information on our phone usage and options to curb your usage. For this next project, I’d like you to reflect on your own phone use and highlight something about your findings.

### Instructions

1. For at least a week, study your phone usage and document your findings in an are.na board. Findings can be notes, screenshots, drawings, images, videos etc.
2. Once you have some data, reflect on your findings. How do you use your phone? Do you do something different than what your classmates do? Are there any patterns in the content you spend the most time with? Are you surprised by any of your findings? Is there some kind of content you gravitate towards?
3. Based on your research, pick a topic to highlight for your project. Create a series of short videos/animations around this topic.
4. House your videos on a simple responsive website. (programmed)
