### Overview

Are.na, a platform for organizing research, was created around the idea of generosity and aims to provide a healthy way of using the internet. As a designer, you have the ability to create experiences for users that influence how they use their time and see the world. With this in mind, create a mobile application that’s meant to be helpful in some way. Perhaps it’s a tool to help your life in a small way, such as an app that helps you remember friends birthdays or maybe it’s something a little bigger in scope that helps bring awareness to a social issue. Consider what would be helpful to an audience larger than just yourself and develop a thoughtful app experience to support it.

### Instructions

The final deliverable for this will be a presentation that explains your concept, highlights the most memorable parts of the design and the design process, highlights an extension of the brand (what would be an interesting extension that supports your concept? Ideas: social media design, email design, t shirt or memorabilia. Only show something that speaks to the brand concept) and ends in a demo of a clickable prototype. Your prototype does not have to be the complete app. Instead, it should highlight the main screens as well as a few interactions that highlight the purpose of the app and show off the design language.

<!--
### Tasks
1. Once you settle on an idea, create wireframes and a user flow for all the pages you’ll need.
2. Investigate what the app should look like. Research examples of similar apps (they don’t have to have the same purpose, but perhaps they have a similar user flow). Create an overview of what your design inspiration is. Do you need photography for your app? What about illustrations? Create an art direction list of all the assets you’ll need to communicate your vision. Create three different iterations of a few main pages.
3. Decide on your execution and finalize the design. Create a functioning prototype for it.
4. Create a presentation that explains your project in a memorable, concise, and visual way. Imagine that this is the deck you would show to an investor who wants to help you make your project a reality. The presentation is part of the design, as well. Make sure that anything you present supports the visual identity of your application.
5. On the final you’ll present your presentation as well as a demo of your app. -->
