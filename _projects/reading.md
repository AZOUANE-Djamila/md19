### Overview

Many people use their phones as a device for reading. Letâ€™s practice creating a comfortable and thoughtfully designed experience at a variety of screen sizes.

### Instructions

1. Find a text to typeset. The text should be written by an outside source, and be published online, either by the author or a third party at some point in time. Be prepared to explain why you chose the text.
2. Using what you know so far about responsive design, design a simple website that captures the spirit of the text. Have fun and have justifications for why you chose to design it in such a way and for what you choose to add to the text, if anything. (I.e Photographs, illustrations etc.)
3. Design your homepage at 3 screen sizes: wide screen (1440 x 900), laptop (1200 x 800), and mobile (use the dimensions of the phone you have)
4. Preview your design using sketch mirror
