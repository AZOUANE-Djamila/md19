### Overview

Many people use their phones as a device for reading. While we reflect on our own thoughts on the internet, letâ€™s practice creating a comfortable and thoughtfully designed experience at a variety of screen sizes.

### Instructions

1. Write a journal entry about your first memories of using the internet. The entry should be as long as you&rsquo;d like, but 2 paragraphs is a good number to aim for.
2. Using what you know so far about responsive design, design a simple website that captures the spirit of the text. Have fun and have justifications for why you chose to design it in such a way and for what you choose to add to the text, if anything. (I.e Photographs, illustrations etc.)
3. Design your homepage at 3 screen sizes: wide screen (1440 x 900), laptop (1200 x 800), and mobile (use the dimensions of the phone you have)
4. Preview your design using sketch mirror
5. Upload all 3 versions to an InVision document.
